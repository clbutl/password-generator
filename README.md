# password-generator

## Description

This project was a way for me to test the waters when it comes to coding with Javascript. It included a lot of new coding challenges that I was not completely aware of when I came into this, but I think it was a crucial step in my learning process. A lot of this week's challenge was creating the code to filter through the different inputs from the user. 

# Challenges

This challenge came with many challenges throughout the entire project. These challenges included displaying the password, showing the entire thing in one piece, along with filtering through the different inputs from the user.

## Displaying the Password

Displaying the password was exceptionally challenging. This main was because of how the functions were origionally set up. A main issue was that I was used to displaying things in the console log, and not on screen.

### The picture below shows the console log, where I could show the password origionally, but had troubles showing it in the actual main text box.

## Creating the Password

Creating the password was a challenge for me, because I had a major issue with creating the password well, but in multiple, 1 character logs. My issue was that the password would be completely split up. 

### An example of this is below.

## Filtering Through User Inputs

The longest lasting issue that I dealt with while working through this challenge was the input filters. The main reason why this was difficult was because there were so many different possible outputs, and I would have troubles with making these outputs work correctly while not messing with other functions.

##  Conclusion

I believe that this challenge successfully showed me my strengths and weaknesses when it comes to learning how to code, and it was a great step in the right direction. I learned how I should go about challenges with Javascript, along with some different ways of thinking about problems when it comes to coding itself. Overall, this challenge helped me get more comfortable with coding and I am happy I put so much time into it.
